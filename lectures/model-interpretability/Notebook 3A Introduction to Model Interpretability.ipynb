    "Throughout the **Machine Learning 1** course, we learned all about different machine learning algorithms- how they work, how we can hypertune their hyperparameters, and how we can select the optimal model through a cross validation strategy. In the end, we can now train a machine learning model and use it to make predictions on unseen data (see Figure <a href='#fig:ml-nutshell'>1</a>).\n",

In particular, we lack the capacity to answer questions such as:\n",

    "\n",
    "In Christoph Molnar's [Interpretable Machine Learning](#ref:molnar) book [[1]](#ref:molnar), he collated two definitions of **interpretability**. A non-mathematical one:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Interpretability is the degree to which a* ***human*** *can* ***understand*** *the cause of a* ***decision***. [[2]](#ref:miller)\n",
    "\n",
    "And a mathematical one:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Interpretability is the degree to which a* ***human*** *can consistently* ***predict*** *the* ***model’s result***. [[3]](#ref:kim)\n",
    "\n",
    "In both definitions we see three important elements: the **human**, the **understanding**, and the **decision**. Thus, in the same way, when we construct our definition for *interpretability* in the context of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Model interpretability*** *refers to the degree in which the behaviors and tendencies of statistical and machine learning models are understandable to humans.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice here that there is a *flexibility* in the definition of model interpretability. Indeed, defining how explicable a machine learning model is depends on the needs and requirements of a project and the different stakeholders. Nevertheless, as ethical machine learning practitioners and data science leaders, model interpretability MUST be integrated as early as possible in the development process and should NOT just be taken as an afterthought."

    "Now, one might ask, why bother with interpretability? Wouldn't a high model performance would ultimately yield to higher business value? This is quite a arguable topic! In fact, in 2017, the [Neural Information Processing Systems](https://nips.cc/) conference in 2017 had its first ever ***The Great AI Debate*** with the topic ***Is interpretability necessary for machine learning?*** [[4]](#ref:great-ai-debate) *(you are highly encourage to watch this engaging and insightful discussion* 🙂).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, it was shown that model interpretability is crucial especially for some applications where quirky patterns from the data may be learned by the model. Indeed, having an interpretability pipeline in your project gives you, the Data Scientist, the ability to debug your model and identify issues early on. Thus, giving you a chance to improve your model. Furthermore, it has added benefits for other stakeholders that is interested and affected by your machine learning model (see Figure [2](#fig:stakeholders)).\n",

Furthermore, it helps them justify the business case for the investment and identify other potential extensions and business use-case for the project. **Approving authorities** also benefit from model interpretability, by having a clear understanding of the risk the business is going to take in adopting the model, understanding the impact of the model decisions to humans, and anticipate any legal or regulatory issues that the model may face. Finally, **customer** experience and decision making can also be improved if they understand why a model gives a certain prediction.\n",

    "## 1.3 What makes a good explanation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin explaining predictions of machine learning models, it helps to understand what makes an explanation good an acceptable for humans. We are making explanations, after all, for a humans to be digested. This help us better frame the model explanations we get from model interpretability methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the few important characteristics of a good explanation *(see Chapter 3.6 of Molnar's Interpretable Machine Learning for a complete list [[1]](#ref:molnar))*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contrastive** - Model explanations must be able to answer *why a given prediction has been made in place of another prediction*. For example, in a model that recommends whether an individual be given a loan or not, a good explanation must be able to tell *what factors should/could I change to alter the model prediction*.\n",
    "2. **Selective** - We *humans are only capable to comprehend 2 to 3 variables at a time*. Thus, a good model explanation must be able to *list the important drivers to explain an outcome*. Imagine having an interpretable model such as linear regression or decision trees, but an explanation that looks at hundreds or thousands of variables, it would be really hard for any human to digest that explanation!\n",
    "3. **Consistent with prior beliefs** - Model explanations are greatly affected by how people perceived them. As such, when *an explanation is consistent with the prior beliefs of an individual*, they tend to favor such explanation ( also known as **confirmation bias**). This is not to discredit any novel or serendipitous discoveries of the model explanation. However, having an explanation that is in line with a domain expert, helps in the model's adoption. Furthermore, if a model is found to exhibit behavior inconsistent with the domain expert's belief, we can enforce constraints on the model or use a linear model that has the required property.\n",

    "We've established the differences between the goals of predictive versus explanatory modeling. Notice that more often than not, when we focus on predictive accuracy, we sacrifice theoretical accuracy for improved empirical precision. Indeed, when it comes to choosing the model with the highest predictive accuracy, the optimal models are not the most interpretable. (see Figure <a href='#fig:accuracy-interpretability'>2</a>) [[9]](#ref:interpret-ml).\n",
